# DevCC-Data-Career-Planning

This project is a look at various jobs in data, as well as different cost indices for many countries
in order to decide where to start my career in data

DevCC - Data Career Planning.twbx: This is the first part of the project where I created visualizations and dashboards with actions
in order to explore the data and search for insights

DevCC - Data Career Planning-part 2.twbx: Part two of the project is where I created a story in order to cohesively explain why I
came to my conclusions
